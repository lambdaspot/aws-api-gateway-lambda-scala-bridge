# aws-api-gateway-lambda-scala-bridge

A thin Scala wrapper for seamless Amazon API Gateway Lambda proxy integration.

A Scala 3 bridge for [`aws-lambda-java-core`](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/tree/main/aws-lambda-java-core) designed to work with API Gateway Lambda proxy integration, using
[Jsoniter-Scala](https://blog.lambdaspot.dev/the-fastest-and-safest-json-parser-and-serializer-for-scala) to streamline JSON handling for better efficiency.

Mainly meant as an example to use in blog articles and has limited functionality. However, it can evolve into a
versatile library supporting various Lambda types and IO monad integration.
